description: In playing out the Silent Game, the intention is to provide a stage for
  experiencing directly and collectively some of the communication paradoxes that
  emerge from the design and reading of simple artifacts. The Silent Game allows exploration
  of how meaning gets embedded in, and conveyed through, form, and reveals issues
  of communication between builders and readers of an artifact. The Silent Game provides
  an opportunity to model some of these phenomena, play them out, and witness their
  interactions, thereby enlightening the mechanics of creation and recognition.
