description: The module Visual Calculating continues a theme ? metaphor ? with which
  the class is now familiar, and introduces related themes of framing, reformulation,
  and redescription as essential aspects of design. All are about new and different
  ways of looking at things in terms of what we already know or have at hand. In this
  module, these themes are visited in a very specific computational context, that
  of shape grammars.
